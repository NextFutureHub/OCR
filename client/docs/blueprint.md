## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to create a calm and professional atmosphere, reminiscent of a clear sky or a serene lakeside.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a neutral backdrop that enhances readability and reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: Warm coral (#FF7F50) to highlight important elements and actions, providing a cheerful yet gentle contrast to the primary blue.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, accessible feel that ensures readability across devices.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying any code snippets or technical information clearly.
- Use a clean and intuitive layout, with a prominent upload area and a clear separation between the text display and chat interface.
- Employ subtle animations for loading states and transitions, creating a polished and engaging user experience without being distracting.
